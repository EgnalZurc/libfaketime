Bulk testing of function interception
=====================================

Faketime intercepts some C library functions.  We want to make it
easier to apply certain generic tests across many different functions.

Including a new function
------------------------

To test a function FOO, supply a C snippet in this directory named
<FOO.c>.  This should be a small bit of code that exercises the
function FOO.  It should be self-contained, and it should produce some
kind of description of what happened to stdout.  Take a look at
getpid.c for a simple example.

The data sent to stdout should include the const char* "where" value
(which is an indication of which test framework is using the snippet).
And it should ideally be stable when the associated variable
(e.g. FAKETIME, FAKETIME_FAKEPID, or FAKERANDOM_SEED) is set, and
likely to vary otherwise, especially across a delay of a second or
more.

If the snippet needs to additional #include headers, please add them
in include_headers.h. These #includes will be used by every snippet,
so try to keep it minimal.

Testing across functions
------------------------

If you want to test something systemically, autogenerate code that
uses each snippet.  See test_library_constructors in ../Makefile for
an example.
